Current status:
    1. ImageButton component is added to facilitate button display in messages.
    2. Skeletal apis for text data are added. They should be modified to handle actual API 
       calls, display of buttons and clicks.
    3. ImageButton has an onclick functionality which will help directly calling functions from the api.js file.
